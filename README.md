# Google Code Styleguide

Introduction from the original Google Code Styleguide page: https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/

> Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project.
> It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.
>
> “Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.”
> This project holds the style guidelines we use for Google code.
> If you are modifying a project that originated at Google, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides that apply to that project.
>
> Our C++ Style Guide, Objective-C Style Guide, Python Style Guide, Shell Style Guide, HTML/CSS Style Guide, JavaScript Style Guide,
> and Common Lisp Style Guide are now available. We have also released cpplint, a tool to assist with style guide compliance,
> and google-c-style.el, an Emacs settings file for Google style.
>
> If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, our XML Document Format Style Guide may be helpful.
> In addition to actual style rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.
